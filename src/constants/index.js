    desc: `Muhammad Usman Safder is a computer-science graduate who bridges
DevOps engineering with applied machine-learning research. His toolkit spans
programming languages (Python, JavaScript/C/C++, SQL), frameworks and libraries
(PyTorch, TensorFlow, LangChain, FastAPI, React), databases (MongoDB, MySQL,
PostgreSQL), and cloud-infrastructure tooling (Docker, AWS, Azure, Jenkins,
Terraform), giving him end-to-end command from code to cloud. At Xgrid.co—a
DevOps and cloud consultancy—he fortifies Terraform modules and automation
pipelines for AWS and GCP, even supporting air-gapped deployments that demand
rigorous security. Parallel to industry work, he leads deep-learning research
at GeniSys Lab, contributing to publications in top-tier venues such as
Nature Scientific Reports and IEEE Access. From citizen-driven
traffic-violation detection systems to large-scale Urdu OCR, his projects show
a knack for translating cutting-edge AI into impactful, real-world solutions.`,
